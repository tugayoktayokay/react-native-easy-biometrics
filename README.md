![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/react-native-easy-biometrics?color=%231F7AE0)

## Overview

React Native easy Biometrics is a straightforward and minimalistic React Native package designed to provide developers with an API for implementing user authentication using on-device biometrics. This library facilitates the quick verification of the app's user, ensuring that sensitive information is only accessible to authorized individuals, such as the phone owner or a trustee.

## Installation

To get started with React Native easy Biometrics, you can add it to your project using Yarn:

```bash
$ yarn add react-native-easy-biometrics
```

## Minimum Requirements

- iOS target: `8.0`
- Android minSdkVersion: `21`

## iOS Permission

To utilize the Face ID system on iOS devices, it is mandatory to include an entry in your iOS app's `info.plist`, explaining the valid reason for using biometrics:

```xml
<key>NSFaceIDUsageDescription</key>
<string>a valid reason to use biometrics</string>
```

When you call the `authenticate` function, iOS users will be automatically prompted for permission. For more granular control over when to request permissions, you can utilize the [react-native-permissions](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-permissions) package.

## Usage

React Native easy Biometrics offers two main methods:

1. `canAuthenticate()`: Checks whether the device supports biometric authentication. Returns `true` if the hardware is available or if permission for Face ID (iOS) was granted.

2. `requestBioAuth(promptTitle: string, promptMessage: string)`: Initiates the biometric authentication process, displaying a user-friendly prompt with the specified title and message. This function can be used for user authentication.

Here's a code snippet demonstrating how to use these methods:

```javascript
import RNBiometrics from 'react-native-easy-biometrics';

// Check if biometric authentication is available
const can = await RNBiometrics.canAuthenticate();

if (can) {
  try {
    await RNBiometrics.requestBioAuth('prompt-title', 'prompt-message');
    // Code to execute when authenticated
    // ...
  } catch (error) {
    // Code to handle authentication failure
    // ...
  }
}
```
